# gradian

Gradian is my own long term project of basicaly building a working game from almost scratch using various tutorials and tricks.

I study computer science so this project is collection if things that i keep learning while studying.

Right now i have no exact plans what i want to do with the game, my current goal is to get a working platform to start working on ("game engine").
